Lingua::Preferred

Many web browsers let you specify which languages you understand.
Then they negotiate with the web server to get documents in the best
language possible.  This is something similar in Perl.

which_lang() takes a list of languages the user understands, such as
qw(en es) and a list of those available on the server, such as qw(en fr
de), and it returns the language to use.  There is some fooling around
with picking second-best 'dialects' of a language, for example if the
user's language is en_IE and a page is available in en_US.

acceptable_lang() takes a list of languages the user understands and a
single language, and returns true iff that language is acceptable.
Again it assumes that different dialects of a language are mutually
comprehensible.
